    "#### High employee turnover rate has never been fun for a company to have. After spending a significant amount of fund in benefits, trainings, and other activity based costs, a company cannot really force the employees to stay. Recruiting new employees is the only way to keep the business going, but it is not cheap. The worst thing about losing employees is not knowing the reason behind it. Without knowing the reason, recruiting more employees will be useless and ended up losing money even more. \n",
